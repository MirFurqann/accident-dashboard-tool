Accident Dashboard Tool
=======================
This is a Solution part of the Furqan Ul Islam's  Bachelor Thesis. 
The prototype is developed using the Python Lanuage and the dataset used for this prototype is modified version (Modified By Furqan Ul Islam, Author of this tool) of the original dataset taken from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nextmillionaire/car-accident-dataset.


Abstarct of The Thesis : This bachelor thesis presents the development of an advanced, interactive web-based visualization tool designed to analyze the correlation between daytime conditions and traffic accidents.
Traditional traffic accident analysis relies on static visualization methods, which fail to capture temporal accident trends and provide real-time insights.
Addressing these limitations, this research introduces a dynamic, data-driven platform that integrates critical factors—including road traffic, weather conditions, road density, driver behaviour, and vehicle characteristics—to offer a more comprehensive and interactive understanding of accident patterns. 
To overcome deficiencies in existing methodologies, this study employs cutting-edge visualization techniques such as animated heatmaps, time-series analysis, and geospatial mapping powered by Plotly Dash. 
Furthermore, statistical modelling—incorporating regression analysis and correlation studies—is utilized to quantify the impact of environmental factors on accident risks. 
The proposed tool is developed as a one-page Python Dash application, utilizing HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for layout styling, and Plotly for interactive frontend visualizations, while Pandas and NumPy handle backend data preprocessing. 
Machine learning models(HistGradientBoostingClassifier)  are implemented using Scikit-learn, analysing historical accident data to predict risk factors based on time-of-day variations and weather conditions. 
Rigorous testing ensures high performance, precision, recall, and usability, with real-time evaluation metrics and user feedback guiding refinements. 

Overview
--------
This project is a one-page interactive Dash-based dashboard and machine learning workbench designed for analyzing UK-style road traffic accident datasets (~60,000 rows).
It supports both geographical and statistical analysis and allows for real-time predictions based on user input.
It includes features like data upload, preprocessing, dynamic filtering, a variety of visual analytics, animated visualizations, and ML-based severity and road type predictions.

Key Features
------------
✔ CSV upload and automatic data cleaning  
✔ Multi-select filters (Year, Severity, Weather, Light Condition, Road Type, Hour Period)  
✔ Hourly histogram with animation by month  
✔ Severity pie chart with time-based slider  
✔ Animated severity bar chart by day period (Morning, Afternoon, Evening, Night)  
✔ Interactive visualizations:  
  • Road Type Distribution  
  • Light & Weather Condition  
  • Spatio-Temporal 3D Cube  
✔ GIS Density Heatmap and Animated Day Period Map  
✔ ML Workbench: Gradient Boosting classifier for Severity and Road Type  
✔ Real-time prediction form with classification report
